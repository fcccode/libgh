== Synopsis

libgh supports interfaces to C and C++.

Currently the interface to C++ is a bit of a kludge.

BIG NOTE: version 1.3 will be changing everything!!!

== Getting Started

The library has been provided in a binary form, 
so it has been compressed with gzip.

=== Extract the library

Ensure you know the architecture and platform of your project.

On linux try,

----
$ uname -m
----

Each version is `.gz`d.

==== Manual Extraction

NOTE: the `-k` option will retain the source archive.

----
$ gunzip -k <version>/libgh-<arch>-<platform>*.gz
----

The versioning info is likely to change in the near future to meet standards.

Do not get too hardcoded about the way they are labeled now.


==== Easy way?

Try
	`$ make prepare`

Then you will want to link to a target to use tst/ as per displayed info.


=== Copy the headers

the headers are alongside the library.

the 'C' header is always necessary.

the 'C++' header is only necessary if the project requires C++ interfaces.
